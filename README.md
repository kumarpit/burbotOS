As part of [CPSC 436A: OS Design and Implementation](https://tfjmp.org/UBC-CPSC-436A/), we implemented an operating system closely mirroring [Barrelfish](https://barrelfish.org). While I can't share the code, take a look at my team's final report that outlines our design decisions, challeneges, and learnings!
